# Course status

Made by `npm run status` on 2026-11-07. Don't edit this file: change the lessons, the review queues or `tools/lesson-status.json` and run it again. How to keep it current: [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#keeping-the-status-table-current).

A lesson's status is the first step it still waits for, in the order: student read-through, Gemini copy edit, fact check, photos. "Also waiting on" lists the later ones.

A course is in beta (version 0.x) until Rob releases it (1.0). The bar for asking him: every planned lesson written, and every lesson through the read-through, the Gemini copy edit, the fact check and its photos. Versions go up only when someone runs `npm run release` (tools/release.mjs), not with every change.

## Clouds <a id="clouds"></a>

`courses/clouds`, version 0.1 (beta, 2026-11-04). The oldest course. Its prose went through several student read-throughs (Oct 2026) and a physics review of the sky lab (3 Nov), but never a Gemini copy edit or a full fact check.
