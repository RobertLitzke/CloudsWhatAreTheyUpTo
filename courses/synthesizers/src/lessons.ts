// Every lesson, written or to come, and the branches of the lesson tree.
// Written lessons are JSON in src/lessons/; the rest are listed here as
// "coming", so the home page shows the whole plan. The first nine are
// PatchMatch's nine stages, one module of the synth each (STAGE_LESSONS in
// core/campaign.ts ties a stage to its lesson). The plan for the rest (lessons
// 10-23 and the branches) is the doc "Synthesizers: plan for lessons 10 onward".
